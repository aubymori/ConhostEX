# How to Install
1. Download conhost.exe from the latest release
2. Take ownership of and rename conhost.exe in System32
3. Put the downloaded conhost.exe in its place

# How to Use
By default, only the client-edge style will be enabled. To enable the classic
frames, open the Registry Editor, create `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console\ClassicTheme`
as a DWORD, and set it to 1.
